# RCBot2 - Universal Source Engine Support Configuration
# This configuration file automatically loads support for multiple Source engine games.
# 
# Game Detection:
# The bot will automatically detect which game is running based on the gamedir setting.
# If no gamedir matches, it will fall back to the first configured mod (CUSTOM).
#
# IMPORTANT! To use RCBot2 with a specific game:
# Say for example you added RCBot2 in D:\SteamCMD\teamfort2\tf\addons\rcbot2
# Then the [gamedir = tf] line should match your game folder.
# Be sure to change those configs properly for RCBot2 to load correctly.
